# Automorphism Group
$Aut(K):=$ Group of isomorphisms from $K$ into $K$
# Fixed Subfield
for an automorphism $\sigma$ of the field $K$ the collection $\{a\ |\ \sigma(a)=a\}$ forms a subfield of $K$
# Groups and Fields
$Aut(K/F):=$ set of automorphisms fixing a subfield $F$ of $K$

such automorphisms permute the roots of irreducible polynomials over $F[x]$

# Field fixing Automorphisms of the splitting field

$|Aut(E/F)|\le [E:F]$

set $n:=[E:F]$

trivial if $n=1$ or if $f(x)$ splits completely in over $F$
but if $f(x)$ has an irreducible factor $p(x)$ with root $\alpha$ then $[F(\alpha):F]$ is the maximum number of simple extensions of $F$ generated by a root of $p(x)$. Now the commutative diagram of fields and homomorphisms allows us to count by multiplication $|Aut(E/F)|$.

but $|Aut(E/F(\alpha))|\le [E:F(\alpha)]$ by induction, so that by multiplicative property of degree of extensions, $|Aut(E/F)|\le [E:F]$


# Galois Extension
* A finite extension with $|Aut(K/F)|=[K:F]$, here the automorphism group fixing $F$ is called the **Galois Group** of $K$ over $F$.
* Composition of galois extensions need not be galois.
## Examples
1. $F_{p^n}$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^n}-x$ over $F_p$ and any $\phi\in Aut(F_{p^n}/F_p)$ has order n, this is because the frobenius endomorphism generates this group.
