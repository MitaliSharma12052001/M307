# Field
Commutative Division Ring
## Invariants
1. Characteristic:
	 smallest $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n.1_F=0$  
2. 



# Prime Subfield

$char(F)=p$ then, $\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}$ is the prime field of $F$ (field generated by $1_{F}$)

 

# Field Homomorphisms
## proposition

a homomorphism from a field $F$ to a field $F'$ is either $0$ or $injective$ 
 
## proof

$Ker(\phi)$ = $Ideal\ of\ F$ but a field has only two ideals, i.e $0$ and $F$ thus either $\phi$ is **injective** or trivial.
 

# Extension of a Field
* constructing fields to contain roots of polynomials in base fields polynomial ring.
##  Existence of a field extension
### proposition

if $f(x) \in F[x]$ is an irreducible polynomialwith no roots in $F$, then $\exists$ an *extension* of $F$ that contains the root.
 
### proof (constructive)


$\lt f(x)\gt $ is a prime ideal in an integral domain and hence is a maximal ideal.
So, we can define $K:=\frac{F[x]}{\lt f(x)\gt }$, a field. now this field contains a root of f(x)
because, $\bar{x}=x\ mod(f(x)) \in K$
and $f(\bar{x})=\bar{f(x)}=f(x)\ mod (f(x))=0$
 
## Degree of Extension
* notation:
	 $[K:F]$  
* definition:
	$dim(K\ as\ a\ vector\ space\ over\ F)$
 
### minimal polynomial and basis for  $K(F)$ 
#### proposition

if $p(x) \in F[x]$ is a monic irreducible polynomial with root $\theta$ and degree $n$ then, defining $K:=\frac{F[x]}{\lt p(x)\gt }$ contains the root,
and $\alpha=x\ mod(p(x))\in K$ then $\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots,\alpha^{n-1}\}$ forms a basis of $K\ over F$ 
 
#### proof

Let $g(x)\in \frac{F[x]}{\lt p(x)\gt }$ then, $g(x)=b(x)$ with $deg(b(x))\lt n$
thus $\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots,\alpha^{n-1}\}$ spans $K$.
assume $\Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1}(c_i\alpha^i)=0$ in $K$ thus, $p(x)|\Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1}(c_i\alpha^i)=0$
but $deg(p(x))=n\gt n-1=deg(\Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1}(c_i\alpha^i)$
so, $c_i=0\  \forall\  i \in {0,1,2,\dots,n-1}$
hence $\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots,\alpha^{n-1}\}$ are LI in $F$
Therefore we conclude that $[K:F]=n$
 




## simple extension

If $K$ is a field extension of $F$ and $\alpha \in K$ then, $\exists!$ minimal subfield of K containing $F\ and\ \alpha$, called $F(\alpha)$
 
### proposition

$F(\alpha)\cong\frac{F[x]}{\lt p(x)\gt }$
 
### proof

$\phi:\ F[x]\rightarrow F(\alpha)$
$f(x)\rightarrow f(\alpha)$
$Ker(\phi)=\lt p(x)\gt \ \because p(\alpha)=0\implies p(x)\subseteq Ker(\phi) $ and $g(x) \in Ker(\phi)\implies g(\alpha)=0$, but $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial, hence $\lt p(x)\gt =Ker(\phi)$
Consider the induced map $\bar{\phi}:\frac{F[x]}{\lt p(x)\gt } \rightarrow F(\alpha)$, an injective map, since it is a homomorphism of fields ( $\lt p(x)\gt $ is a maximal ideal), also it is surjective (contains both $F$ and $\alpha$)

 
## example of finding  $h(x)^{-1}$  

$p(x)=x^3-2\ \in F=\mathbb{Q}[x]$
$K:=\frac{\mathbb{Q}[x]}{(x^3-2)}\cong\{a+b\theta+c\theta^2; a,b,c \in \mathbb{Q} , \theta=x\ mod(p(x))\}$
$h(x)=1+\theta$
but $(1+x)\ and\ (x^3-2)$ are co-prime
so that $a(x)(1+x)+b(x)(x^3-2)=1_F$
so $a(x)(1+\theta)=1_F\ mod(x^3-2)$ 
$(1+\theta)^{-1}=a(x) \in K$
 
## Uniqueness of simple field extensions
### proposition

If $\Phi$ is an isomorphism of field $F$ and $F'$ and $p(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ with root $\alpha$, and $\beta$ is a root of it's image $p'(x)$ , then $F(\alpha)\cong F'(\beta)$ 

### proof

The bijective ring homomorphism induced by $\Phi$ from $F[x]$ to $F'[x]$ takes the maximal ideal $\lt p(x)\gt$ to $\lt p'(x)\gt$ which therefore must be maximal, implying that $p'(x)$ is irreducible over $F'[x]$

Thus $p'(x)$ is irreducible over $F'$. The field surjective homomorphism from the respective quotients is then, by Lemma 1, an injection.

And since the quotient fields are respectively isomorphic to $F(\alpha)$ and $F(\beta)$, we have by composition, an isomorphism of $F(\alpha)$ and $F(\beta)$.




# Algebraic Extension
## Definition

$L\supset F$ an extension, is said to be an algebraic one if each element $\alpha$ in $L$ is algebraic over $F$, that is

$\exists p(x) \in F[x]$ such that $p(\alpha)=0$

## Minimal Polynomial
### Existence of Min Poly
For every $\alpha$ algebraic over $F$, $\exists!$ monic polynomial $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ such that $m_{\alpha,F}(0)=0$ and if for $f \in F[x]$ $f(\alpha)=0$, then $m_{\alpha,F}(x)|f(x)$.

#### proof

$\alpha$ is algebraic $\implies\ \exists g(x)\in F[x] \ with g(\alpha)=0$

multiplying out by a constant, assume $g(x)$ is monic. Choose $g(x)$ to be of minimal degree.

such a $g(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$ else $g(x)=a(x)b(x)\implies a(\alpha)=0\ or b(\alpha)=0 \because\ F[x]$ is an integral domain.

Thus contradicting the degree minimality of $g(x)$

now similarly using the Euclidean algorithm on any $f(x)$ anhillated by $\alpha$ we get $r(x)=0$.

### Min polys in Extensions
#### proposition

If $L\supseteq F$ is an extension of $F$ then, $m_{\alpha,L}(x)$ | $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$

#### proof

since $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ is a polynomial in $L[x]$ having $\alpha$ as a root.

### degree of an algebraic element
#### definition
degree of its minimal polynomial, which by construction of $F(\alpha)$ as a quotient field is equal to the degree of $F[x]$ over $F$ and is called the **degree** of the element $\alpha$ in $F$.
#### algebraicity and degree
##### proposition
an element $\alpha$ is algebraic over a field $F$ iff its degree over $F$ is finite.
##### proof
If $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ then it satisfies a minimal polynomial of say degree n in F, and hence the degree of the extension $F(\alpha)$ is finite=n.

Conversly, if $F(\alpha)$ is of finite degree over $F$ then, $\{1,\alpha,\dots,\alpha^n\}$ being n+1 elements of $F(\alpha)$, satisfy for some $b_i \in F$ the relation

$\Sigma b_i\alpha^i=0$  , thus $\alpha$ satifies $f(x)=\Sigma b_ix^i\in F[x]$ to give $\alpha$ is algebraic over F.
##### corollory
a finite extension is algebraic.

## Transitivity of Algebraic Extensions
### proposition
If $L$ is algebraic over $K$ and $K$ is algebraic over $F$, then $L$ is algebraic over $F$.
### proof
consider an element $l\in L$, which by algebraicity, satisfies some polynomial $k(x)=\Sigma_0^nk_ix^i$ hence the degree of it's minimal polynomial over $K$ is $\lt n$, say $n_l$, but each $k_i \in K $ is algebraic so that

$F(k_0,\dots,k_n)$ is a finite(of say, degree m) and hence algebraic extension of $F$ with $k_i$'s as members, and hence $[F(l,k_0,\dots,k_n):F]\le n.n_l$, giving that l is algebraic over $F$ for any arbitrary element $l\in L$
# Multiplicative nature of Degree of extensions
## proposition
if $L$ is an extension of $K$, which is an extension of $F$ then,

$[L:F]=[L:K][K:F]$
## proof
Let $\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_m\}$ be a basis of $L/K$ and $\{\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n\}$ of $K/F$
#### claim1
${\alpha_i \beta_j\}$ spans $L$ over $F$

for any $l \in L$ we have $l=\Sigma k_i \alpha_i$ and for any $k_i \in K$ we have $k_i=\Sigma f_{i,j}\beta_j$ 

giving $l=\Sigma\Sigma f_{i,j}\alpha_i \beta_j$
#### claim2
${\alpha_i \beta_j\}$ is linearly independent over $F$

$0=\Sigma\Sigma f_{i,j}\alpha_i \beta_j$ $\implies \Sigma f_{i,j}\alpha_i =0 \ \forall j \in [n] $ $\implies f_{i,j} =0\ \forall i \in [m], j \in [m]$
# Composite field
## definition
$K_1K_2$ is the Smallest field extension of $F$ containing two extensions $K_1$ and $K_2$ of it.
## relations to tensor products
when  $[K_1K_2:F]= [K_1:F][K_2:F]$, then the basis elements of one field are LI over the other, and when we define a ring homorphism,
$K1 \bigotimes_F K_2$ $\rightarrow K_1K_2$, since they are of same dimensions, it is an isomorphism and hence $K1 \bigotimes_F K_2$ is a subfield of $K_1K_2$
# Splitting Fields
## Definition
smallest (in terms of containment) field extension of $F$ in which $f(x)\in F[x]$ splits completely into linear factors.
## Existence
### Existence of Splitter Field E
We use **induction** on $n=deg(f(x))$ 
for n=1, set $E=F$

now assume $n\ge 2$

if all irreducible factors of $f(x)$ have degree 1, we again set $E=F$

now assuming $f(x)$ has an irreducible factor $g(x)$ of degree $\ge 2$

Taking $\alpha$ to be a root of $g(x)$ and constructing the simple extension $F(\alpha)$ we have $f(x)=(x-\alpha)h(x)$ with $deg(h(x))=n-1$, so by induction,

we have an extension $E$ of $F(\alpha)$  such that h(x) has all its roots in $E$ but this also contains $\alpha$ and hence $f(x)$ splits completly in $E$

### Smallest Subfield
Now, let $K$ be the intersection of all the subfields of $E$ containing $F$ which also contain all the roots of $f(x)$. Then $K$ is a field which is a splitting field for $f(x)$.

## Uniqueness
If $\phi:\ F\rightarrow F'$ is an isomorphism then it induces a ring homomorphism $F[x]\rightarrow F'[x]$ so that $F(\alpha)\cong F'(\alpha')$

($\alpha$ being a root of a irreducible factor of $f(x)$ which maps to an irreducible factor of $f'(x)$ with root $\alpha'$ )

and by recursion and composition

$K\cong K'$

## Degree
* Bounded by $n!$ where $n=deg(f(x))$
Obvious from construction by recursion adjoining roots.
## Cyclotomic Fields
Field of $n^{th}$ roots of unity

$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n^{th}$ root of unity.

$[\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n):\mathbb{Q}]=\phi(n)$ , that is, the number of order-n elements in the cyclic group generated by $\zeta_n$.


# Algebraic Closure
## Definition
Smallest field extension that contains **all the roots** of **all the polynomials** in $F[x]$ 
## Closure is Closed
### proposition
algebraic closure of $F$, $\bar{F}$ is closed.
### proof
for $f(x) \in \bar{F}[x]$, with root $\alpha$ we have $\bar{F}(\alpha)$ is algebraic over $\bar{F}$ which is algebraic over $F$ and hence by transitivity of algebraicness, $\alpha$ is the root of a polynomial in $F[x]\implies \alpha \in \bar{F}$

Hence $\bar{F}$ is closed.


## existence
### proposition
for every field $F$ there exists a closed field $K$ containing $F$
### proof
consider the polynomial field of infinite variables over $F$

now take non-constant monic variables $f_i$ in one variable, i.e., in each co-ordinate

consider the ideal $I=\lt f_i(x_i) \gt$ of $F[x_1,\dots]$, which is proper because if the identity polynomial $1\in I$ then 

$\exists\ g_i(\bar x)$ such that $\Sigma g_i(\bar x)f_i(x_i)=1$ but take $a_i$ to be roots of $f_i$ then $\Sigma g(\bar a)f(a_i)=0\ne 1$

So by Zorn's Lemma we have a maximal ideal $M$ containing $I$

construct $K_0:=\frac{F[x_1,\dots]}{M}$, which has the roots of all polynomials $f \in F[x]$ 
continue on $K_i$

take $K:=\cup K_i$

which is closed and contains $F$.


### the closure
all the elements in $K$ that are algebraic over $F$ form a closure of $F$.
# Frobenies Endomorphism
In a field of characteristic $p$, we have $(a+b)^p=a^p+b^p$

So that the map $\phi:= F\rightarrow F$ taking $a \rightarrow a^p$ is injective.

now this is an homomorphism and hence for finite fields, an ismorphism so that every element is a $p^{th}$ power.


# Seperable polynomial
## definition
roots are distinct in the splitting field.
## equivalent condition
$gcd(Df(x),f(x))=1$, i.e., they do not share a root.
because if they had a common factor, say $h(x)=(x-a)g(x)$, then $f(x)=(x-a)p(x)$ so that $Df(x)=p(x)-p'(x)(x-a)$ which is divisible by $(x-a)\iff p(x)=(x-a)q(x)$ $\iff a$ is a double root of $f(x)$

## in a field of characteristic 0
any irreducible polynomial is seperable and so is a product of distinct irreducible polynomials.
## in a field of charecteristic p
first, note that $Df(x)=0\implies f$ is a polynomial in $x^p$

# Existence of prime power fields
???
# Perfect fields
a field $K$ of characteristic $p$ is called perfect if $K=K^p$ or if $p=0$
# Seperable field
every element of the field is the root of a seperable polynomial.
## rmk
every finite extension of a perfect field is seperable.

# Cyclotomic polynomials
## proposition
$[\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n):\mathbb{Q}]=\phi(n)$
## proof
min poly of $\zeta_n$ is $\Phi_n(x)=\Pi_{(a,n)=1, a\lt n}(x-\zeta_n^a)$, because
### sub claim 1
$x^n-1=\Pi_{d|n, d\le n}\Phi_d(x)$
because $x^n-1=(x-\eta_1)\dots(x-\eta_n)=\Pi_{d|n, d\le n}\Pi_{(a,d)=1, a\lt d}(x-\zeta_d^a)=\Pi_{d|n, d\le n}\Phi_d(x)$
### sub claim 2
$\Phi_n(x)$ is a monic polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with degree$=\phi(n)$

This is true by induction since $x^n-1=\Phi_n(x) \Pi_{d|n, d\lt n}\Phi_d(x)$ $\implies deg(\Sigma_{d|n, d \le n}\phi(d))=n=deg(\Phi_n(x))+\Sigma_{d|n, d \lt n}\phi(d)$ ,

and hence we are done using division algorithm and gauss lemma.
### sub claim 3
$\bar{\Phi_n(x)}$ is seperable in $\mathbb{Z}_ p[x]$ for a prime $p \cancel{|} n$.

because by $D(x^n-1)=nx^{n-1}\ne 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_ p$ for $p\cancel{|}n$ thus the roots of unity are distinct in $\mathbb{Z}_ p$ for our choice of $p$.
### sub-claim 4
$\Phi_n(x)$ is inseperable

Say $\Phi_n(x)=f(x)g(x)$ with $f(x)$ being irreducible. Now $\zeta_n$ is a root of $f(x)$
if $f(x)$ is not necessarily the min poly of $\zeta_n^p$, then $\zeta_n^p$ would have be a root of $g(x)$. 

Now this gives $\zeta_n$ is a root of $g(x^p)$ and hence the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_n=f(x)|g(x^p)$

but in a field of characteristic $p$ $g(x^p)\equiv g(x)^p$ and hence $f(x)|g(x)$ so that $\bar{\Phi_n(x)}$ is inseperable, a contradiction.

In any case, $f(x)|\Phi(x)$

### sub-claim 5
now $\Phi(x)|f(x)$ because for any $a=\Pi p_i$ not necessarily distinct primes $p_i$ such that $(a,p)=1$ ,

we have $\zeta_n$ is a primitive root of unity $\implies \zeta_n^{p_1}$ is a primitive root of unity and by recursion $\zeta_n^a$ is a primitive root of unity. 

thus $\Phi(x)$ is a monic irreducible polynomial with the same roots as $f(x)$ so that it is the min poly of $\zeta_n$
